*Last updated 11 August 2025*

Each extended abstract published in [*BISS*](https://biss.pensoft.net/) is a peer-reviewed mini-paper designed to provide you with a value-added, easily citable snapshot of your work. *It is not a verbatim repetition of the abstract submitted to the conference platform.* Using Pensoft’s [ARPHA writing tool](https://arpha.pensoft.net/), you can enhance and lengthen your abstract, so that it includes figures, keywords, references, even supplementary materials. Slides, posters, and a link to the video of your presentation may also be added to the abstract’s media tab after the conference, to build a well-rounded presentation of your work. Each published abstract can link to your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), will have a DOI assigned (see below), and provides metrics about views, downloads, citations, or even online mentions of your work.

Abstracts submitted to the conference platform were purposefully kept succinct (≤300 words) to facilitate prompt review for the purposes of programming the conference. 

TDWG has had a successful partnership since 2017 with Pensoft Publishing to publish the [Proceedings](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections) of its conferences, including those of [Biodiversity\_Next 2019](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/115/). [Pensoft Publishers](https://pensoft.net/) is a valued sponsor of Living Data 2025. We now offer the opportunity to have your abstract included in the open access [Proceedings of Living Data 2025](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/516/). This is a benefit of your registration for the conference and acceptance of your presentation. 

If the presenter or submitting author is a [TDWG member in good standing](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/#membership-durationschedule) for 2025 and registered for the conference, there is no additional cost to publishing an extended abstract. Non-TDWG members will be charged a nominal fee of €50 (plus VAT, if applicable\*). A limited number of discounts for non-TDWG member authors/presenters, who registered for the conference as students or from [countries with discounted registration fees](https://livingdata2025.com/registration.html), may be granted upon request. Please contact editor@tdwg.org. 

See the [Call for Extended Abstracts](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-extended-abstract-call/) for how to get started \- Deadline for Submission: **1 October 2025\.**

### Additional benefits of publishing an extended abstract include:

* Free and open access to your abstract in perpetuity via TDWG’s open access Pensoft journal, *Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)*.  
* Automatic linking of your abstract to your author record via ORCID and/or Web of Science (Publons) ResearcherID.  
* A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) assigned to each abstract. This DOI is a unique, persistent, and citable reference that enables your abstract to be part of your publishing history above and beyond the conference proceedings. *Note that during and following the conference, your abstract on the conference platform will only be visible to conference delegates. The abstract will require a login to see it, and will not be publicly accessible. No DOI will be minted for individual abstracts submitted to the conference platform.*  
* Distribution of abstracts under the terms of [Creative Commons attribution licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/), either [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (default) or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (by request).  
* At least two editors will review and may provide editorial comments for each abstract.  
* Post-publication, readers can comment or ask questions within the Comment tab in the publication. Authors may also use the Comment tab for updates (see example [here](https://biss.pensoft.net/article/59089/list/13/)) or errata.  
* To prompt discoverability, all articles, including abstracts, are automatically harvested upon publication by a range of [indexers](https://biss.pensoft.net/), from [AGRICOLA](https://www.nal.usda.gov/agricola) to [ZDB](https://zdb-katalog.de/index.xhtml).  
* Abstracts will be associated with the conference session in which they are presented.  
* Easy to promote your presentation by sharing your abstract on Bluesky, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Telegram, Mendeley, Reddit, or via email with a single click, thanks to share buttons.

\* VAT is applicable only for VAT NON-registered customers based within the European Union. To avoid being charged VAT, the EU companies or persons should provide their VAT registration numbers validated with the EU taxation database ([https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/)).
