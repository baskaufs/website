# **Call for extended abstracts**

Soliciting submission of extended abstracts to *Biodiversity Information Science and Standards* of presentations at Living Data 2025 in Bogotà, Colombia

We are pleased to announce the call for extended abstracts (mini-papers) for Living Data 2025 to be published in [*Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)*](https://biss.pensoft.net/).

**Deadline** for extended abstract submission is **3 September 2025**

**Why?** Wondering why you might want to submit an extended abstract when your original abstract was already accepted for presentation at the conference? See all the [reasons why here](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/why-extended-abstract/).

**Eligibility**. Only an abstract approved for presentation, whose presenter is registered for the conference, is eligible for submission as an extended abstract. *The person submitting the extended abstract to BISS may be a different co-author from the one who submitted the original abstract to Living Data 2025\.* It is important that this submitting author be available to handle reviews in a timely manner.

**Cost.** Presenters or abstract submitters who are [TDWG members](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/#membership-durationschedule) in good standing for 2025, and are [registered for the conference](https://livingdata2025.com/registration.html), will have the publication fee waived as a member benefit. Non-TDWG members will be charged €50 (plus VAT, if applicable\*). A limited number of discounts for non-TDWG member authors/presenters, who registered for the conference as students or from [countries with discounted registration fees](https://livingdata2025.com/registration.html), may be granted upon request. Please contact editor@tdwg.org.

**Getting Started.** Full instructions for extended abstract submission may be found at [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstract-submission/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstract-submission/) but if you are already familiar with abstract submission to *BISS*, you may elect to use the shorter summarized version, [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstracts-tldr/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstracts-tldr/)

Please direct any questions about extended abstracts to editor@tdwg.org.

We look forward to receiving your extended abstract submissions by **3 September 2025**.
