# **Call for extended abstracts**

We are pleased to announce the call for extended abstracts (mini-papers) for Living Data 2025 to be published in TDWG's open-access Pensoft journal, [*Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)*](https://biss.pensoft.net/). 

[Pensoft Publishers](https://pensoft.net/) is a valued sponsor of Living Data 2025. Please join them in Bogotá at booth #8 to find out more about their open-access peer-reviewed [journal portfolio](https://pensoft.net/browse-journals) and attend their symposium [6788879 - Long Live Biodiversity Data: Knowledge Transfer and Continuity across Research Projects](https://www.livingdata2025.com/sessions.html?session=6788879).

**Deadline** for extended abstract submission is **1 October 2025**

## Why submit?

Wondering why you might want to submit an extended abstract when your original abstract was already accepted for presentation at the conference? An extended abstract published on BISS enjoys most of the benefits of a conventional research article, such as DOI registration, indexing at dozens of scientific databases, embedded media, tables and supplementary materials, and usage metrics. See all the [reasons why here](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/why-extended-abstract/).

## Eligibility 

Only an abstract approved for presentation, whose presenter is registered for the conference, is eligible for submission as an extended abstract. *The person submitting the extended abstract to BISS may be a different co-author from the one who submitted the original abstract to Living Data 2025\.* It is important that the submitting author be available to handle reviews in a timely manner.

## Cost

Presenters or abstract submitters who are [TDWG members](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/#membership-durationschedule) in good standing for 2025, and are [registered for the conference](https://livingdata2025.com/registration.html), will have the publication fee waived *for their first abstract* as a member benefit. If you are part of an institutional delegation, *up to five abstracts* will have publication fees waived for each institutional membership. This benefit is in lieu of the [conference registration discount](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/#benefits-of-membership) normally afforded to TDWG members.

Non-TDWG members and TDWG members submitting more than one abstract will be charged €50 (plus VAT, if applicable\*) per submission. A limited number of discounts for non-TDWG member authors/presenters, who registered for the conference as students or from [countries with discounted registration fees](https://livingdata2025.com/registration.html), may be granted upon request. Please contact editor@tdwg.org.

\* VAT is applicable only for VAT NON-registered customers based within the European Union. To avoid being charged VAT, the EU companies or persons should provide their VAT registration numbers validated with the EU taxation database ([https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/)).  

## Getting Started

Full instructions for extended abstract submission may be found at [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstract-submission/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstract-submission/) but if you are already familiar with abstract submission to *BISS*, you may elect to use the shorter summarized version, [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstracts-tldr/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstracts-tldr/)

Please direct any questions about extended abstracts to editor@tdwg.org. Make sure to reference all abstract identifiers in the subject line of your email. This call may be found on the [TDWG conference website for 2025 Bogotá](https://tdwg.org/conferences/2025/).

## Deadline

We look forward to receiving your extended abstract submissions by **1 October 2025**.
