Don't miss out on this important benefit of your registration and presentation at SPNHC-TDWG 2024. See "[Why submit an extended abtract](/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/)" if you have lingering doubts.


## Original call

We are pleased to announce the call for extended abstracts (mini-papers) for the joint hybrid conference of SPNHC-TDWG 2024 to be published in [_Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)_](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/438/). 

**The deadline for extended abstract submission is ~~15 July 2024~~ ~~NOW 24 July 2024.~~ 15 October 2024**

Wondering why you might want to submit an extended abstract when your presentation has already been accepted on the Oxford Abstracts (OA) conference platform?  See all the reasons why here: [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/) 

**Eligibility.** Only authors with abstracts [approved and presented](/conferences/2024/#abstracts-submitted-to-oxford-abstracts)) at the conference are eligible to submit an extended abstract as a benefit of their registration for the conference. _The person submitting the extended abstract to BISS can be a different co-author from the one who submitted the original abstract to the conference program._ It is important that this submitting author be available to handle reviews in a timely manner.

**Full instructions** for extended abstract submission may be found at [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/](/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/) but if you are already familiar with abstract submission to _BISS_, you may elect to use the shorter summarized version, [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/](/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/) 

**Please direct any questions** about extended abstracts to [editor@tdwg.org](mailto:editor@tdwg.org).

We look forward to receiving your extended abstract submissions by **15 October 2024** (final deadline!)
