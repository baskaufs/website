## Virtual sessions for interest, task, and maintenance groups

Interest and task groups are the driving force for developing and maintaining TDWG standards.  The TDWG community is dynamic -- people come and go -- so every year we hold virtual working sessions to:

- inform the wider biodiversity informatics community about the group's work;
- review progress to date;
- engage new contributors; and
- set the agenda for this year's work.

The TDWG community spans the globe, so it's difficult to reach everyone at a reasonable hour.  Some groups will hold their session twice to reach the East or West hemispheres at convenient times. But note, if the scheduled time is inconvenient or you have a conflict, we will also record every session and post the videos on the TDWG YouTube channel.

## Schedule and registration

Working session will be held over two weeks, April 14-25.  The images below show the sessions in each week.  

See the [**detailed schedule**](/community/working-sessions/2025/) for the time of each session translated into your local time zone, and the **link to register** for each session.
