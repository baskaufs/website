## TDWG and ICZN Sign Memorandum of Understanding

TDWG is pleased to announce the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). This agreement marks a significant step toward closer collaboration in promoting biodiversity data standards and the integration of zoological nomenclature into global informatics efforts.  

The partnership underscores our shared commitment to advancing open science, ensuring interoperability, and supporting the long-term accessibility and usability of taxonomic information.  

We look forward to working together with ICZN to strengthen the foundation of biodiversity data worldwide.

### Remarks

*“Scientific nomenclature aims to bring clear and unambiguous data-sharing and communication about species, and strengthening the ICZN-TDWG axis would seem a win-win situation in a time where ‘big data initiatives’ are increasingly important for safeguarding and managing our ecosystems.”*  (**Thomas Pape, President, ICZN**)

*“Scientific nomenclature is the informatics backbone underpinning all of taxonomy, which itself is the scaffolding around which almost all biodiversity data is organized. As indicated by its acronym, TDWG’s origins are centered on taxonomic databases, and this MoU represents an important step towards harmonizing biodiversity data in a way that will enrich and empower it to serve critical societal needs.”* (**Richard Pyle, Former Commissioner, ICZN**) 

*“Biological data-sharing standards are the foundation that permit meaningful exploration of the world around us and interoperability across diverse systems. This collaboration between the ICZN and TDWG represents and renews our shared commitment to open access to data and our support for science and discovery of the natural world.”* (**David Bloom, Chair, TDWG**)
