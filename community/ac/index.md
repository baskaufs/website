## Motivation

This interest group is established to meet the requirements in Section 2.1 of the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification: to maintain the Audiovisual Core vocabulary.

## Becoming involved

The interest group welcomes the participation of individuals who have a vested interest in maintaining the stability and interoperability of Audiovisual Core. We need people with interest and experience in vocabulary creation, people who are well versed in best practices for metadata documentation, people with technical data management skills, and people who are experts on various types of media. If you are interested in participating in the group, please contact the convener or a core member.

The day-to-day operations of the Maintenance Group are managed in the group's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tdwg/ac). You can find there contact information for all of the core members, [records of meetings](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/tree/master/historical), and a tracker for [issues](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues) currently under consideration by the group. The issue tracker also contains information about upcoming scheduled meetings.

## History and context

The Audiovisual Core vocabulary (formerly Audubon Core) was ratified as a TDWG Standard in 2013 to represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and collections. It imports terms from various existing vocabularies, including Darwin Core, and mints terms in cases where existing terms are insufficient. Audiovisual Core records allow a user to determine the fitness for use of a resource before actually acquiring the resource itself. For an introduction to Audiovisual Core, visit <https://ac.tdwg.org/introduction/>. For details, see R. A. Morris et al. 2013. Discovery and Publishing of Primary Biodiversity Data associated with Multimedia Resources: The Audubon Core Strategies and Approaches. Biodiversity Informatics, 8(2). <https://doi.org/10.17161/bi.v8i2.4117>

## Summary

The Audiovisual Core maintenance group is responsible for maintaining the various components of the Audiovisual Core standard. That includes managing suggested changes to the vocabulary, providing usage guidelines and examples, and ensuring the preservation and stability of metadata related to components of the standard.
