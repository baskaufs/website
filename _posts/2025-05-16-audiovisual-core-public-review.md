The [Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group](/community/ac/) would like to announce the start of the public review of proposed additions to the standard.  The public comment period will remain open through at least 17 June, 2025.

The additions are documented as GitHub issues with the tag "public comment" and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22public%20comment%22).

In summary, the proposed changes are:
  - Adding the terms ac:filterLowPass and ac:filterHighPass for bioaocustic recordings.
  - Adding the term ac:Digital3DResource to allow for 3D representations within Audiovisual Core in anticipation of the final proposals of the 3D Task Group.
  - Proposal to create a controlled vocabulary for content description.
  - Proposal to add ac:commentDate.
