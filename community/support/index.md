## What is the TDWG Community Support Fund?

TDWG interest, task, and maintenance groups undertake the core business of our organization: developing and maintaining standards and guidelines that facilitate the integration of biodiversity information. TDWG is committed to supporting its interest/task/maintenance groups by contributing to the costs of conducting working meetings. Support is provided through a fund dedicated to this purpose, the TDWG Community Support Fund (CSF). The size of the fund is adjusted yearly by decision of the TDWG Executive Committee.

## What does the TDWG CSF cover?

1. Travel and subsistence support for participation in IG/TG working meetings.
1. Costs directly related to the organization of IG/TG working meetings, including venue hire.
1. Costs related to the dissemination of the workshop/meeting results and engagement of stakeholders.

## Who can apply?

TDWG IG/TG conveners may apply for funds to (co-)organize IG/TG working meetings.

The CSF can be used to support any phase of work that an IG/TG undertakes, from a kick-off meeting to that gets stakeholders fully engaged with the proposed methodology and work plan (potentially a large meeting), to the final phase of writing and polishing needed to get a specification ready for review or publication of the standard (a smaller and longer meeting).

Please be aware that proposals from Groups that have a current annual report will be given preference. A [guide to reporting](/community/management/guide-to-reporting) and a template for IG/TG annual reports (as [GoogleDoc](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1VYHouWmgh94zUibFgDlTW_6cwCTsYbl6Kq9vsczFPjA) or in [Markdown](https://github.com/tdwg/website/blob/master/assets/documents/annual-report-template.md)). See [Responsibilities of conveners](/community/management/) for a more comprehensive description of responsibilities.

## Call frequency

Provided that sufficient resources are available, a call for applications will be announced once every calendar year.

## Evaluation criteria

1. Previous activity of the group, proven through annual reports submitted to the TDWG Executive Committee or other public reports and products (not applicable to new groups*)
1. Overall impact, timeliness and cost efficiency
1. Inclusiveness of participation (e.g., engaging new participants and/or expanding geographic representation)
1. Expected progress on development of new or revision of current TDWG standards
1. Additional funds or in-kind support committed from other sources, such as a grant, institutional budgets, staff-time, or funds for travel support. (Attaching your working meeting to another meeting or conference can help leverage in-kind travel support.)
