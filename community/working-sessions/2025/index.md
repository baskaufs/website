## Virtual sessions for interest, task, and maintenance groups

Interest and task groups are the driving force for developing and maintaining TDWG standards.  The TDWG community is dynamic, however, so every year we hold virtual working sessions to:

- inform the wider TDWG community about the group's work;
- review progress to date;
- engage new contributors; and
- set the agenda for this year's work.

The TDWG community spans the globe, so it's difficult to reach everyone at a reasonable hour.  Some groups have opted to hold their session twice to reach the East or West hemispheres at a convenient time. We hope all sessions to be recorded and posted on the TDWG's YouTube channel.
