The complete instructions for reviewing/editing 2025 extended abstracts may be found [here](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-editing/). This high level summary provides relevant links to that document. 

TL;DR, or "too long; didn't read" is an example of slang or jargon, which we've told authors not to use. Your job is to make sure that they do what we say, not what we do!

## Getting started

1. Familiarize yourself with author requirements ([TL;DR for authors](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-abstracts-tldr/))  
2. Notification of abstracts to review in ARPHA will come via awt@pensoft.net  
3. List of abstracts available to be reviewed are found (when logged in) on your [ARPHA dashboard](https://arpha.pensoft.net/dashboard?showall=1&state_type=23) with [status](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/biss-editing/#abstract-status) “in pre-submission review” \- abstracts in “Draft” are unavailable.  
4. Attend to reviews promptly  
5. Only one reviewer may be in an abstract at a time; close the window when not working.

## The review

1. [**Track Changes**](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Track-Changes) \- correct grammar, spelling, or style issues; suggest wording changes  
2. [**Comment**](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Comments) \- select relevant text and add comment or question for authors to resolve, mainly about content  
3. [**Status flags**](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-editing/#editorial-review-status-flags) \- check to mark editing/reviewing progress  
   1. Language reviewed \- verified spelling, grammar, consistency of style  
   2. Content reviewed \- examined structure, logic, clarity, & context of text and other materials (figures, tables, references, etc)  
4. [**Action flags**](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2025/biss-editing/#editorial-review-action-flags) \- check to mark recommended actions by volume editors  
   1. Revise  
   2. Approve  
   3. Rarely used: Move, Reject, Remove  
   4. Not used: Accept with revisions
5. **It is very important to both use flags in ARPHA and to record their status in the ATS with your initials**
6. **DO NOT** use the Send feedback button for any reason  
7. Enter status and action flags in Abstract Tracking by Sessions worksheet (link sent separately)
