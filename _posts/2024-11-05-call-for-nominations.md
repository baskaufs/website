TDWG is an international organization that promotes the digitization, integration, and sharing of information about the world’s biodiversity. TDWG provides a forum where individuals, projects, and institutions who manage biodiversity data can come together to share expertise and promote interoperability by promulgating standards and best practices. TDWG also publishes the Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS) journal where papers on issues related to information technology and biodiversity science can be published.
